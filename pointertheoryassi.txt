2. int *p, q; What does both of these terms signify?
ANS: *p shows that it is a pointer and q shows that it is an integer.

3. Predict the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;
b = *ptr + 1;
ptr = &b;
cout << *ptr << ‘ ‘ << a << ‘ ‘ << b;

ANS: output will be 11 10 11

4. Predict the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 15, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;
int *ptr2 = &b;
*ptr = *ptr2;

ANS: a gets the value of b

5. Predict the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr;
*ptr = 5;

ANS: output will give a garbage value as ptr does not have address of any variable so it will show garbage value.
